<p align="justify"> I used def to define the function alphabet_soup (s). I then used ''.join to join the characters in one continuous string with '' as a separator. I also used sorted(s) to take the string s and arrange the characters in alphabetical order. I stored them in str and returned str to be the output of the function. I printed my name with the function and it resulted with the letters fixed in alphabetical order. </p>

## __2. EMOTICON PROBLEM__: Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence as a string, replace the words smile, grin, sad, and mad with their corresponding emoticon:

<p align="justify"> I used e to input the "Type here:", it will make you type there and check if the replaced words will work. Using def to define the emotify (e). After that, I stored in e the e.replace to replace smile with ":)", grin with ":D", sad with ":((", and mad with ">:(". After replacing the words, I returned e for the output and printed emotify(e). You will see after running the code, the "Type here:" and I typed "I smile and grin. I am sad and mad.". It resulted in the emoticons I used to replace the words. </p>

## __3. UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM__: Unpack the list write your code here into three variables, being first, middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element. Then print all three variables.

<p align="justify"> I stored in c my favorite colors, which are purple, baby pink, baby blue, white, black, and blue gray. In order to print the first, middle, and last, I printed "first:" with c[0], 0 is the first element, which is purple. Then I used to print "middle:" with c[1:-1] that starts with baby pink (1) and not including the last element (-1). It slices the elements and gives the middle ones. Then lastly, I printed "last:" with c[-1] that will print the last color, blue gray. </p>
