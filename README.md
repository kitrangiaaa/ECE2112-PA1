<p style='text-align: justify;'> I used def to define the function alphabet_soup (s). I then used ''.join to join the characters in one continuous string with '' as a separator. I also used sorted(s) to take the string s and arrange the characters in alphabetical order. I stored them in str and returned str to be the output of the function. I printed my name with the function and it resulted with the letters fixed in alphabetical order. </p>
